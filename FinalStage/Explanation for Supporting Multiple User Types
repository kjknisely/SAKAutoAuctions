Explanation for Supporting Multiple User Types

Multiple user types provided complexity to this web application. The web 
application provides the user with more or less functionality depending 
on which user type logs in and engages with the interface. For example, 
in the Menu Bar, the items indicated as (Admin Only) are only available
to be used by the Admin user type. This is important because it separates
access levels depending on whether the user is an administrator/executive,
in contrast to a member of the general public. This approach promotes and
reinforces the idea of increased database security to ensure that updated,
valid, data is able to persist at all times when a user is engaged with the
site. From an enterprise software development perspective, this implementation
could be extended further by implementing optimistic locking as an addition
to the database security to ensure that no two users are attempting to update
a specific row of data at the same time.
